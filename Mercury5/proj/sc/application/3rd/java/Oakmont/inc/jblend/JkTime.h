 *  Store the elapsed time (monotonic increasing value) in millisecond
 *  as a 64-bit value to the arguments <i>high</i> and <i>low</i>.
 *  It is recommended that the elapsed time starts from 0.
 *  Because this function is called by an arbitrary timing after JVM starts, 
 *  it is necessary to begin the count before JVM starts.
 *  
 *  The JVM presupposes that the value obtained by this function increases
 *  monotonically.
 *  However, if this function is called until the next time the elapsed 
 *  time is actually updated, it is OK to pass the caller the same value 
 *  as the previous function call. For an example, if the time resolution 
 *  is 10 milliseconds, this function passes the caller a same value at 
 *  every calls in the period after the time is updated until 10 
 *  milliseconds elapses.
 *
 *  In case of JVM suspension, the elapsed time may stop increasing.
 *  However, when JVM restarts, the elapsed time needs to be updated as if
 *  it were continuously increased during the JVM suspension.
 *  Even if the system time has been changed in JVM suspension, 
 *  the JkTimeGetCurrentTick() return value must increase monotonically in 
 *  time order regardless of the changes.
 *
 *  The JVM controls the thread using the value returned by this function.
 *  Since the accuracy of the elapsed time influences the accuracy of
 *  JVM execution directly, this value should be acquired with the highest
 *  possible accuracy.
 *  It is recommended that the accuracy ranges within 10 milliseconds.
 *
 *  @par For compliance with JTWI 1.0:
 *  The elapsed time returned by this function must have a resolution of 40 ms or better.
